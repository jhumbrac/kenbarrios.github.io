		<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
			<p>I was most inspired by the <a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank">Quartz</a> and <a href="http://www.thegreenwichhotel.com/penthouse/" target="_blank">Tribeca Penthouse</a> websites.</p>

		<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
			<p>Unlike other news sites, Quartz focuses on providing a less cluttered approach to presenting the news. They start off with a massive headliine image for their top story, which covers the majority of the screen when you log on, then they keep all other stories evenly stacked underneath by having all subsequent stories stretched across as individual story rows. 
			<br>
			Tribeca Penthouse also focuses on hitting you with a full image. They use the 3 column arrangment to organize their short blurbs about the penthouse that they are promoting. The text alternates from left to right, as you  move down from one massive div image to the next.</p>

		<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>
			<p>Both sites leave you feeling fully immersed in the subject matter.
			<br>
			However, whereas the Tribeca Penthouse website gives equal importance to each of it's massive divs, the Quartz website provides hierarchy and direction by starting with a massive image for the top story, then guiding you down to text only, full rows for subsequent stories, and then full image + text rows for their backlog of stories. This creates an "hourglass" figure to the page, while remaining top-heavy for emphasis on the lead story.</p>
